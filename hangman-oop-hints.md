## Hangman Game Guidance

Here's a sensible approach you might use to build this.  At a minimum, you should commit for each one of these steps, but several of them might be multiple commits. 


## `Word`

* Create a `Word` class.  When a round of the game starts, we will instantiate this and store it in the `game` object.

* The `constructor()` should take a word (string) as an argument.

* Inside the constructor, use the word to create an array of objects.  Each object will correspond to a letter.  Each object will have 2 properties: `character`, which is the letter, and `guessed` which is a boolean that indicates whether the letter has been guessed or not.  You could optionally create a `Letter` class and make these objects instances of that. 

* **Test your `Word` class.** Instantiate a `Word` a few times.  Print the instantiated word in the console and drill down into the object and make sure it instantiates correctly.

* Add a method `getWordString()` to the `Word` class.  It should **return** a string corresponding to the word in its current state.  If a letter has been guessed, it should print that letter.  If not, it should print a `_` character.  Be sure to put a space between each character in the returned string so you can see the individual blanks for the unguessed letters.

* **Test your `getWordString()` method.** Instantiate a few words and call `getWordString()` on them, making sure you get the correct number of `_`s. Manually change some of the letters' `guessed` to `true` and make sure that causes the letters to show up in the returned string.

* Add a method `checkLetter()` to your `Word` class.  It should:
  * take a `character` as an argument, and
  * go through the array of letter objects and change the `guessed` boolean to true if the guessed letter matches that letter in the array (if the letters are instances of the `Letter` class, maybe `letter` should have a method `markGuessed` that does this), and
  * return `true` if the letter was found in the array, or return `false` otherwise. 

* **Test your `checkLetter()` method.** Instantiate a few words, and call `checkLetter()` on them and:
  * make sure the return value is `true` or `false` as appropriate
  * call `getWordString()` on them to make sure the words print correctly.

Now, you've got a `Word` class (and maybe also a `Letter` class) that could be used in _any_ hangman game.  That's a great thingâ€”you're being modular!  You want to make each part (class or function) of your code as reusable as possible. 


## `game`

Let's move on to the `game` object.

Think about how hangman works.  And take look at the guidelines in the assignment, that's often a good place to start thinking about what code you might want to write, at least at a high level.

> Track and inform user of guessed letters and guesses remaining

* Any time you need to "track" data like this, that's application [**"state"** (check out the "Program State" section)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)) data, (i.e. the state of your app at any given point).  You should create some properties in your main object to track this type of data, so add an empty `guessedLetters` array, and a `guessesRemaining` value (initial value of 7 or 8 as indicated in instructions).

* What other data do you need to "track" for one round of the game? How about your instantiated word?  What would be a good name for that property? How about `currentWord`. Don't try to set/instantiate the random word directly as the object property, just initialize that property to be `null`.

* But when _will_ the word get initialized?  Well, when the round starts, right?  So let's add a method `startRound()` that gets a random word from your `wordBank` array, instantiates a `Word` with it, and stores that instance in that `game.currentWord` property (remember to use `this` when referring to the `game` object inside of methods on the `game` object!)

* **Test your game so far.**  Put a call to `game.startRound()` in the global scope, and then type `game` in your console and check that a random word got instantiated.  Sweet!  You're committing right?  This would be a great time. 

* What else should happen when the round starts?  Think about playing hangman in real life.  We want the user to guess a letter, right?  But first, we should probably show them the blanks... that's usually how hangman works, right?

* We're going to need to keep showing the word with its guessed/unguessed letters to the user, so maybe we should have a method in the game object that prints the word.  Let's call it `printWord()`.  It should use Vanilla JS or jQuery to print the word on the page, perhaps in some container you create in the html.  Pro tip: use CSS to style that container to have a fixed-width font like Courier or Courier New.

* Now, call the `printWord` method inside of `startRound` after you instantiate your `Word` class.

* Test it again!  You should see your word on the page when you reload.  Check everything by comparing what you see on the page (number of blanks) to what should be there (i.e. check the word's length in the console, see if the number of blanks are the same)

Alright!  Now you're ready to start thinking about guesses.

> Letters must be guessed with keypresses

* Despite the mention of keypresses, _don't worry about the event listener yet._ Add a method called `checkUserInput()` in the `game` object.  It should take a parameter -- a letter, and call the `currentWord`'s `checkLetter()` method.  Think: what should it do next? 

  * `currentWord.checkLetter()` will return `true` or `false` depending on whether the letter was there or not.  How can you use this information? 
  
  * If the letter was there, then what should happen next? the user should get some feedback.  Your app should communicate to the user what is happening.  If the letter wasn't there, well we should communicate that to them too. 

  * So we need a way to display a message to the user in multiple places in our app.  How about a game method called `displayMessage()` that takes a message string as a parameter and displays it in the DOM? 

  * And, in `checkUserInput()` write some conditional logic to tell them something nice if they did good or adminish them if they guessed wrong. 

  * If the guess was bad, don't forget to reduce `guessesRemaining`, and store the guessed letter in `lettersGuessed`!

  * And either way, there are two other things that need to happen:

      * We should show them the word again, in case anything changed.  Do we have a method that prints the `currentWord` in the HTML with its letters and blanks?  (Hint: yes -- Call it!)

      * It would also be nice to tell the user how many guesses they have left. And what letters they've guessed.  In fact, we're going to need to do this a lot of times.  Make a method `printStats()` in the `game` object that prints the `lettersGuessed` and the `guessesRemaining` on the page. 

      * make `checkUserInput()` call that `printStats()` method after it checks a guess.  So now `checkUserInput()`
        * checks the guess
        * tells the user what happened
        * maybe adjusts guessesRemaining and lettersGuessed
        * calls printStats()
        * calls printWord

      * Bonus: if they guess a letter they've already guessed, don't count it against them, instead just display a message saying: "you've already guessed that letter."

  * Throughout this process, notice how we're keeping our logic that prints things on the page separate from our logic.  This [_**separation of concerns**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) is a critical concept in Computer Science and programming.

  * **Now** would be a great time to add a keypress or keydown listener.  Add a listener that:
    * figures out what key was pressed
    * calls `game.checkUserInput()` and passes in the key pressed

  * Optional, but nice to include: figure out if the key pressed was a letter.  If 

> You must be able to win or lose one round (either guess word correctly or die trying).

* Phew!  You've basically got the game done now, you just need to figure out how this critical last step.  There are several different ways to pull this off, and if you've made it this far, you probably have a pretty good idea of how this should work.  Try to think through how to implement it!

  <summary>Hints -- only look if you've been stuck on win condition for a while</summary>

  * add a `wordCompletelyGuessed()` method to the `Word` class that returns true if all the letters are correctly guessed

  * use it with some conditionals in the `checkUserInput()`
