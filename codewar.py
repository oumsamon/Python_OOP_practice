# # A square of squares
# # You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# # However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

# # Task
# # Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

# # In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

# # The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

# import math
# def is_square(n):
#     return n > -1 and math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0;

# def is_square(n):    
#     if n>=0:
#         if int(n**.5)**2 == n:
#             return True
#     return False

# #the above didnt count since i had to UNLOCK SOLUTIONS

# Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

# Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
